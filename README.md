# SpinupWP Developer Community - Code of Conduct

## TL;DR

* Don't be a troll
* Be respectful of others
* Do not harass others
* Do not share personal information of others to people outside the community
* All content must be "safe for work"
* Don't spam the spaces with links, or links to pages, for the purpose of monetization of user views and which provide no value to the community

This is a safe space, let's keep it that way.

## Guidelines

Be kind. Don't be snarky. Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.

When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3."

Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith.

Eschew flamebait. Don't introduce flamewar topics unless you have something genuinely new to say. Avoid unrelated controversies and generic tangents.

Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work, thoughts or opinions. A good critical comment teaches us something.

## Code of Conduct

“The SpinupWP Community” or “SpinupWP Community”  in this document refers to the SpinupWP Developer Community organization at [https://community.spinupwp.com/](https://community.spinupwp.com/). “The administrators” refers to the administrators on this organization, which can be accessed [here](https://community.spinupwp.com/members?active=admins), or from the **Members** button next to **Settings** and then select **Admins**. (You must be a member of the organization to view.)

The SpinupWP Community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all SpinupWP Community spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.

Some SpinupWP Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

## Unsolicited private messages (DMs)

While the SpinupWP Community aims to be a place for members of the community to meet and connect, it's also important to respect each other's privacy. If you feel as though a service you provide or business you run may be of use to another member, please respect their privacy and first ask publicly if you may contact them about such discussions before sending unsolicited messages.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of the SpinupWP Community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns please report this to use by emailing community@spinupwp.com. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can also submit an [anonymous report](https://community.spinupwp.com/). Administrators will respond as soon as they are able. If the person who is harassing you is on the admin team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. 

This code of conduct applies to SpinupWP Community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of SpinupWP outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by SpinupWP Community members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the SpinupWP Community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside SpinupWP Community spaces and behavior towards people who are not members of the SpinupWP Community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the SpinupWP Community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Acceptable Content

The SpinupWP Community is a collection of professionals, as such it is expected that the content made available by members of the community should at all times adhere to the acceptable content policy. This policy is intended to protect the community's image, as well as the image of its members, through restrictions on certain classes of content which may be deemed to be unsuitable in a work or family context.

Links to content are deemed as acceptable as the content within.

Classes of content which we deem to be unsuitable include:

 - Pornographic or sexually suggestive material, either in graphic or text form.
 - Depictions of physical or emotional abuse, either in graphic or text form.
 - Persecution of any individual as a result of their race, gender, religion or other physical traits.
 - Material intended to, without basis, harm the reputation of any individual whether a member or not.
 - Unsolicited advertising
 - Links, or links to pages, for the purpose of monetization of user views and which provide no value to the SpinupWP Community.
 - Content infringing on copyright laws.

As a quick self-check, ask yourself whether you would like someone's child to see the content you are posting. If the answer is "no", then there's a good chance you shouldn't be posting it on the SpinupWP Community.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all SpinupWP Community spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other SpinupWP Community members and/or the general public.

Intentionally evading exclusions, bans, suspensions, restrictions, or otherwise interfering with the admin team's decisions and actions are not permitted.

## Terms and Conditions

The administrators may, but are not obligated to, monitor or review any areas on the SpinupWP Community where users transmit or post communications or communicate solely with each other, including but not limited to public and private channels, and the content of any such communications. The administrators, however, will have no liability related to the content of any such communications, whether or not arising under the laws of copyright, libel, privacy, obscenity, or otherwise. The administrators may edit or remove content on the SpinupWP Community at their discretion at any time.
